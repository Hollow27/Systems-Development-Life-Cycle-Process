Stages of the System Development LifeCycle Process (SDLC)

Before we begin, there should be an architecture at least in mind and all build tools ready. If the first page or project just started - create all the necessary folders, sub-folders, configure framework if any used. Let say, you use a Bootstrap and SASS, <h6>then do the 1st step for whole project (all pages you have) to understand the whole architecture</h6> and after that setup SASS variables and build your own Bootstrap.

<h1>Front End</h1>
<h2>Analyzing the Specific Design for the Page</h2>

(psd, sketch, wireframe, proto, whatever the best you have)

1.) Understand the structure of the document, which global sections, sub-sections you will have. Paint layout and grid in your head.

2.) Think about responsiveness, what breakpoints do you have, how layout should change.

3.) Understand each component used on that page. Which one is already implemented (JavaScript) and can be re-used, which one you will need to implement. What is the structure of each component. What is the structure of whole document altogether. Paint your basic HTML markup and DOM in your head.

4.) What assets (images, icons, fonts) are used on the page and by each component, what designer has provided you, what is missing, request if so or export yourself.

5.) How page and each component will work and animate together, are there any instructions provided by a designer, if no - ask. Still remember about the web accessibility and basic UI/UX. In most cases you have power to fix a problem, fix designer mistakes or improve a product before it is shipped. Obviously, today if it is not seen in design that button on hover should change state, you should implement it, but let the design author know about that issue and let him provide a final solution later. If you are working in big/serious/German project or just have a signed contract, then you in most cases don't have rights to change anything in the design which was approved. Is it ugly? Not your problem. However, you still can tell your issue and what are you proposing to a manager/tech lead/customer. In most companies, projects and in startups acting and improving a product on your own is a big plus.

6.) Finally look into colors and other styles. What CSS you already have and can re-use, what you will need to write.
Now you can actually start writing a code.
